# Teaching

This repository contains mostly self-explainatory Jupyter notebooks that are meant to teach aspects of more advanced deep learning methods.

Please see the individual notebooks for original authors' copyrights. This is a compilation of material I found useful for teaching from various source. Most of it has been adapted in various ways, e.g. making it pleasant to use in Google Colab, adapting it to a more involved example (from the medical imaging domain) etc.

Here are individual links to run the above notebooks directly in Google Colab.
